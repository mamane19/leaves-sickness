# Tea Leaf Disease Detection

Welcome to the Tea Leaf Disease Detection project! This project aims to empower tea farmers in East Africa with a tool for early detection and classification of common tea diseases using machine learning.

## About

Tea Leaf Disease Detection leverages the Tea Sickness Dataset to develop accurate predictive models capable of identifying diseases such as Red leaf spot, Algal leaf spot, and Anthracnose. The deployed web application allows users to upload images of tea leaves and receive instant diagnoses.

## Deployment

You can access the deployed application [here](https://predicttea.streamlit.app/). Simply upload an image of a tea leaf, and let the model identify any potential diseases.

## Technical Details

- Built with Python
- Utilizes TensorFlow for model development
- Deployment using Streamlit
